# Fintech Ops Console

Evaluation prototype of a reusable foundation for fintech internal tools containing:

- Refund Operations: queue, detail, approval/rejection/escalation, server-side
  approval limits, and audit history.
- Feature Flags: staging and production controls that reuse the same RBAC,
  audit, API, and UI foundations.

All identities and business data are synthetic. 

## Intended stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI, Python |
| Persistence | SQLite |
| Backend tests | Pytest |

## Local commands

Devin must replace this section with exact, verified install, run, lint, test,
build, and seed-reset commands.

## Prototype limitations

This is deliberately not production-ready. It does not provide real SSO,
production secrets management, a production database, tamper-resistant audit
retention, DLP, vulnerability-management operations, backups, monitoring,
incident response, or real financial-system integrations.
